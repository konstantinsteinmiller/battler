# battler

a Zanzarah-like battle game in a fantasy arena. Created in Three.js with Rapier.js

#### you can try the current version here: [demo](https://konstantinsteinmiller.github.io/battler/#/game) but first load is slow because of the big models (>40mb total)

expected features:
- 3D arena
- Character controller with First and Third person view
- Character can look behind
- AI with pathfinding and collision
- Physics/Collision with rapier.js
- Spells and moving Particle effects
- UI for health, mana, endurance and enemy health
